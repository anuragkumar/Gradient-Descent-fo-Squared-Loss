Following is the description for how to find the weights of a linear equation using graduent descent.
In this code, we will have our linear equation with wweights given. We will randomly generate our response and normally distributed error with mean 0 and SD 2.
We will also have our response calculated from the given equation. Then, we will calculate weights using gradient descent.
All the code is written in R and it also plots graph for how Gradient is decreasing at each iterations.
